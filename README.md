Statistics for Data Science
Overview
This repository is a comprehensive guide to fundamental statistical techniques and their applications in data science. It contains Jupyter Notebooks that cover core statistical concepts, hypothesis testing, and practical Python implementations. Each notebook focuses on specific topics to build a strong foundation in statistics.

Notebooks
1. Descriptive Statistics
Covers key concepts of summarizing and visualizing data.
Topics include:
Measures of central tendency: Mean, Median, Mode.
Measures of dispersion: Variance, Standard Deviation, Range, Interquartile Range.
Data visualization techniques: Histograms, Boxplots, Scatterplots.
Key Libraries Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
2. Probability and Distributions
Explores the fundamentals of probability and statistical distributions.
Topics include:
Basics of probability, events, and rules.
Key distributions: Normal, Binomial, Poisson, Uniform.
Visualization of probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs).
Key Libraries Used: NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy.
3. Hypothesis Testing
Comprehensive guide to hypothesis testing techniques.
Topics include:
One-Sample T-test.
Two-Sample Z-test and T-test (Equal/Unequal Variances).
Proportion Z-tests (One and Two Proportions).
Chi-Square Test for Independence and Variance.
F-test for Equality of Variances.
One-Way ANOVA Test.
Real-world scenarios are used to explain the implementation and interpretation of these tests.
Key Libraries Used: SciPy, Statsmodels.
4. Inferential Statistics
Focuses on sampling and inference techniques.
Topics include:
The Central Limit Theorem.
Estimation: Point and Interval Estimation.
Sampling techniques and their importance.
Confidence intervals and their interpretation.
Practical examples to solidify concepts.
Key Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
